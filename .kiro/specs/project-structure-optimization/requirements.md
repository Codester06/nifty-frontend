# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on optimizing the project structure of the trading platform to improve maintainability, scalability, and developer experience. The current structure has some organizational issues that need to be addressed to create a more professional and well-defined codebase architecture.

3. WHEN accessing utility functions THEN the system SHALL have a dedicated utils directory with categorized modules
4. WHEN working with shared constants THEN the system SHALL have a centralized constants directory

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper separation of concerns, so that business logic is separated from UI components.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent file naming and organization, so that the codebase follows industry best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN naming files THEN the system SHALL use consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities)
2. WHEN organizing pages THEN the system SHALL group related pages into logical subdirectories
3. WHEN creating shared components THEN the system SHALL have a clear common/shared components structure
4. WHEN managing assets THEN the system SHALL organize them by type and usage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript organization, so that types and interfaces are well-structured and reusable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining types THEN the system SHALL organize them by domain/feature
2. WHEN creating shared types THEN the system SHALL have a common types directory
3. WHEN exporting types THEN the system SHALL use proper index files for clean imports
4. WHEN defining API types THEN the system SHALL separate them from UI types

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean import paths, so that imports are readable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing modules THEN the system SHALL use absolute imports with path aliases
2. WHEN organizing exports THEN the system SHALL have proper index files for barrel exports
3. WHEN accessing deeply nested modules THEN the system SHALL avoid relative import chains
4. WHEN importing common utilities THEN the system SHALL have clean, predictable import paths
