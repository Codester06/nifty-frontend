# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will replace the current mock stock data system with real-time stock data integration using the Dhan API. The system will fetch live stock prices, market data, and maintain the existing functionality while providing accurate, real-time market information for Indian stocks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a stock trading application user, I want to see real-time stock prices and market data, so that I can make informed trading decisions based on current market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL fetch real-time stock data from Dhan API
2. WHEN stock prices change in the market THEN the system SHALL update the displayed prices within 5 seconds
3. WHEN the API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to cached data and display a connection status indicator
4. WHEN displaying stock information THEN the system SHALL show current price, change amount, change percentage, and volume
5. IF the API rate limit is exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement proper throttling and queue management

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Dhan API integration to be secure and configurable, so that API credentials are protected and the system can be easily maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the API THEN the system SHALL store API credentials securely in environment variables
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL include proper authentication headers
3. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors appropriately without exposing sensitive information
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate API credentials before attempting data fetches
5. IF API credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and fallback to mock data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the stock data to be displayed in the same format as before, so that the user interface remains consistent and familiar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying stock data THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing Stock interface structure
2. WHEN showing price changes THEN the system SHALL display positive changes in green and negative changes in red
3. WHEN presenting volume data THEN the system SHALL format volume numbers with appropriate suffixes (M, K)
4. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators during API calls
5. IF data transformation is needed THEN the system SHALL map Dhan API response to the existing Stock interface

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chart data to reflect real market movements, so that I can analyze stock performance accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating chart data THEN the system SHALL use historical data from Dhan API instead of simulated data
2. WHEN selecting different timeframes THEN the system SHALL fetch appropriate historical data (1D, 1W, 1M)
3. WHEN displaying charts THEN the system SHALL show actual price movements with proper timestamps
4. WHEN historical data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating limited data availability
5. IF chart data fails to load THEN the system SHALL fallback to the last known data or show an error state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the API integration to be performant and reliable, so that the application provides a smooth user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching multiple stocks THEN the system SHALL implement efficient batch API calls where possible
2. WHEN updating prices THEN the system SHALL implement WebSocket connections for real-time updates if available
3. WHEN caching data THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate cache invalidation strategies
4. WHEN handling API responses THEN the system SHALL process data efficiently to minimize UI blocking
5. IF the system detects performance issues THEN it SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures
