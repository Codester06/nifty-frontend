# üöÄ Gemini's Analysis & Prioritized Development Plan

This document outlines the refactoring and enhancement tasks for the application, primarily focused on `src/pages/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx` and related components.

## üéØ **High Priority & Immediate Fixes**

| Status | Task | Notes |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **TO DO** | **Fix Buy/Sell Functionality:** Ensure `buyStock` and `sellStock` in `useAuth` are fully implemented and working. Remove any time-based demo restrictions. and start buy sell for 24hrs for demo  | **Crucial for core trading functionality.** |
| **TO DO** | **Professional Portfolio Page:** Overhaul `PortfolioPage.tsx` to include a detailed holdings table, performance charts, and key financial metrics. | **High-impact UI/UX improvement.** |
| **TO DO** | **Integrate Dashboard Values:** Connect calculated dashboard values (Total Investment, Current Value, Total P&L) to the portfolio page for consistency. | **Ensures data integrity across views.** |
| **TO DO** | **Debug and Responsive UI:** Debug all files, fix errors, and ensure the entire application is **fully responsive** for mobile devices. | **Required for a production-ready application.** |

## üîå **API Integration & Error Handling (Critical Infrastructure)**

| Status | Task | Notes |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **In Progress** | **Centralize API Calls:** Move all `fetch` calls into dedicated **service files** (e.g., `src/features/wallet/services.ts`) to fully decouple components from the API layer. <br/> - `src/pages/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx` <br/> - `src/components/forms/TradingModal.tsx` <br/> - `src/features/admin/pages/AdminCoinManagement.tsx` <br/> - `src/features/admin/pages/AdminTradingManagement.tsx` <br/> - `src/features/admin/pages/AdminUserManagement.tsx` <br/> - `src/features/admin/pages/MainAdmin.tsx` <br/> - `src/pages/auth/LoginPage.tsx` | **Top priority for clean architecture.** |
| **To Do** | **Robust Error Handling:** Implement a user-friendly notification system (e.g., a toast library) to inform the user of failures instead of relying on `console.error`. | **Improves user experience significantly.** |
| **To Do** | **Loading States:** Implement loading indicators for all asynchronous operations (fetching data, buying/selling stock). | Essential for a professional feel. |
| **To Do** | **API URL Management:** Consistently use `VITE_API_BASE_URL` and ensure a clear fallback for development environments. | Ensures environment consistency. |

## üèóÔ∏è **Component Modularity & Simplification**

### Breakdown of `Dashboard.tsx` (Completed)

| Status | Task | Component Created |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Done** | Break down the "Portfolio Overview" section. | `PortfolioOverview` |
| **Done** | Break down the "My Watchlist" section. | `Wishlist` |
| **Done** | Break down the "Portfolio Holdings" section. | `PortfolioHoldings` |
| **Done** | Break down the "Recent Transactions" section. | `RecentTransactions` |

### Next Steps for Modularity

| Status | Task | Notes |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **To Do** | **Stateless Child Components:** Make child components as **stateless** as possible, passing data and functions down as props. | Enforce clear data flow and reusability. |
| **To Do** | **Abstract Business Logic:** Move business logic (like P&L calculations) into dedicated **custom hooks** or **utility functions**. | Improves testability and separation of concerns. |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **State Management (Refinement & Scaling)**

| Status | Task | Notes |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **To Do** | **Global State:** For data used across multiple components, consider using a global state management library (**Zustand or Redux Toolkit**). | **Mitigates prop drilling and scales the application.** |
| **Done** | **`useAuth` Hook Review:** The hook seems to be doing too much. Further breakdown into more focused hooks (e.g., `useUser`, `usePortfolio`) is the next step. | |
| **To Do** | **Wishlist State:** Sync the wishlist with a **backend service** instead of storing it in `localStorage`. | Required for robustness and multi-device consistency. |

---

## üé® **UI/UX Enhancements & Accessibility**

| Status | Task | Notes |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **To Do** | **Mobile View:** Simplify complex ternary operators for styling, potentially using a more streamlined responsive styling approach. | **Refines the responsive code.** |
| **To Do** | **Empty States:** Improve empty states with more engaging graphics or calls to action. | Enhances user experience. |
| **To Do** | **Accessibility:** Review the component for accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, etc.). | **Critical for a professional application.** |
| **To Do** | **Consistency:** Ensure consistent styling and component usage across the dashboard. | |

---

## üßπ **Code Cleanup & Organization**

| Status | Task | Notes |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **To Do** | **Remove Unused Code:** Fix or remove the undefined `isRecent` variable in the "Recent Transactions" section. | |
| **To Do** | **Type Safety:** Ensure all data from the API has proper **TypeScript types**. | **Improves code maintainability.** |
| **To Do** | **Magic Strings:** Avoid magic strings for things like transaction types (`'buy'`, `'sell'`). Use **enums or constants** instead. | Reduces errors and improves readability. |
| **To Do** | **Comments:** Add comments to explain complex logic, especially the financial calculations. | |

---

## ‚úÖ **Testing Strategy**

| Status | Task | Priority |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **To Do** | **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for the utility functions and custom hooks. | **High** |
| **To Do** | **Component Tests:** Write component tests for the new, smaller components to ensure they render correctly based on props. | **Medium** |
| **To Do** | **Integration Tests:** Write integration tests for the `Dashboard` page to ensure all the components work together correctly. | **Medium** |
