## Summary of Functionality Changes

### Before Cleanup:
- Users could select package and payment method
- Users could confirm payment through the app
- App would process payment via API
- App would update wallet balance after confirmation
- Complex error handling and loading states

### After Cleanup:
- Users can select package and payment method
- Users see payment details (QR code for UPI, bank details for transfer)
- Users complete payment manually through their own apps
- No payment processing or confirmation in the app
- Simplified, display-only interface

## Benefits of Cleanup:

1. **Reduced Complexity**: Removed ~150 lines of payment processing code
2. **Better User Experience**: Clear separation between payment details display and actual payment
3. **Reduced Bundle Size**: Removed unused imports and functions
4. **Simplified Maintenance**: Less code to maintain and debug
5. **Clearer Responsibility**: App only shows payment details, users handle actual payments
